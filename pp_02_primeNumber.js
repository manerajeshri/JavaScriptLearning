First Ten Prime Numbers

The first ten primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

Prime numbers are natural numbers that are divisible by only 1 and the number itself. 
In other words, prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. 
Some of the prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Always remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite.
Also, we can say that except for 1, the remaining numbers are classified as prime and composite numbers. 
All prime numbers are odd numbers except 2, 2 is the smallest prime number and is the only even prime number.

Prime numbers are the natural numbers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, i.e. 1 and the number itself.
